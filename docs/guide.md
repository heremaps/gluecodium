User guide
==========

This guide's goal is to give you, as the user of Gluecodium code generation tool, an overview
which language features Gluecodium offers and how to use them. It also gives you clues where
you need to add your own implementation to the generated code. For a complete syntax
description of LimeIDL please refer to the [LimeIDL description](lime_idl.md).

Overview
--------

Gluecodium generates a C++ API with language bindings for Java, Swift, or Dart. For C++ it will
generate declarations only. These need to be implemented by you to provide application logic.
Java, Swift, and Dart bindings are completely generated and forward all calls to C++.

Crossing the language boundary
------------------------------

When building a mobile app, the entry point for the program will be in Java/Swift/Dart (referred
further as "platform code"). Calls then can be made from platform code into C++ code. Platform code
can call static or non-static member functions. Calling into platform code from C++ is only possible
on objects passed from platform code to C++ first.

**Note:** Both in Java and in Dart the native library needs to be loaded manually before any call to C++ is possible.

Classes
-------

Classes are generated as an abstract class in C++ and as wrapper classes containing all the
conversion and glue code in platform code. These classes have their logic always on C++ side.
New instances can only be created if it is the return value of a function and it is up to
the users C++ implementation which subclass is returned. When the function is called from
platform code the instance will be automatically wrapped.

**Note:** As of now, there is no guarantee of pointer equality on transition from C++ to platform
(i.e. the same C++ object returned twice to the platform side may be represented with different
platform objects).

Structs
-------

Similar to a `class` but considered a value type. It is generated as `struct` in Swift and C++
and as `class` in Java and Dart. Structs are passed by value and since they are value types, all methods
are const. Structs have by default constructors generated in all languages.

**Note:** Although in Java and Dart everything is a reference type, modifications on a struct are
not reflected in C++ unless it is passed to C++ explicitly as a parameter or similar. If
changes need to be propagated a class with properties should be used.

Interfaces
----------

An interface is generated as interface/protocol/abstract-class in Java/Swift/Dart. For C++ the same abstract
class and glue is generated as it would be for classes. Unlike classes, interfaces can also be
implemented in platform code allowing to use platform logic.
When an instance implementing the interface is passed to C++, a proxy
object is instantiated. For the receiver of said object it is transparent whether the
implementation is in platform code or C++.
Although the same wrapper objects as for classes are generated, allowing to implement the
interface also in C++, the main use case is to use services provided by the target platform,
e.g. positioning, notifications, threading etc.

**Note** It is safe to do comparison on the `std::shared_ptr` in C++ to check if it's the same
platform object as passed before. This is not true if C++ doesn't hold a shared pointer
anymore and the proxy is released.

**Note** Holding `std::shared_ptr` of the proxy object in C++ will extend the lifetime of the
object on platform side.

**Note** Interfaces cannot have static methods since not all output languages (and/or their variants)
support such language feature.

Constructors
------------

Constructors are special methods for structs and classes which return a new instance of that type.
Constructors are generated as static method declarations in C++ and can do initialization,
validation and return errors. In platform code these are generated as constructors/initializers to
provide native feel.

**Note:** Having custom constructors on structs disables generation of the default ones in platform code.

**Note:** Constructors are not supported for interfaces.

**Note:** Method overloading generally works for constructors. One notable exception is that a pair
of constructors overloaded on an Array or Map parameter (i.e. having signatures that differ only in
array/map element types) will generate uncompilable code in Java (Swift and C++ will still compile).

Nullable type references
------------------------

You can append a `?` to a type reference, i.e. the usage of a type, to mark it as nullable. In
generated Swift code this property controls whether the type is "optional" or not, therefore
enforcing nullability at compile time. For Java generated code the nullability is expressed through
a @Nullable annotation, enabling compile time enforcing when used with Kotlin language. For C++
generated code for Interfaces the nullability is expressed as a documentation comment.

**Note:** Java annotations are only generated if these are specified via command line parameter.

**Note:** The C++ generated code will use `optional` to express nullability for non-Interface types.
Which implementation is used depends on the compiler version: Gluecodium uses `std::optional` if available,
but falls back to a custom implementation of it otherwise. This behavior can be overwritten with defines,
see generated `Optional.h` header.

Documentation comments
----------------------

Comments can be formatted in [Markdown](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/) and links to other
types can be added in the form `[package.Interface.method]`. For properties the syntax
`[PropertyName.set]` and `[PropertyName.get]` can be used to refer to setters/getters
explicitly. Without suffix the reference will link to the getter in languages which have
getters and setters.


Annotations
-----------

### Language annotations: @Cpp, @Swift, @Java, @Dart

Language annotations allow to set attributes specific to a generated language. All of them support
setting a custom name for the annotated element which will be used for generation.

#### `@Cpp(ExternalName=..., ExternalType=...)`

`@ExternalType` and `@ExternalName` can be used to skip generating C++ code but only generate
Java/Swift and glue code. This is useful when exposing already existing C++ APIs.
For external structs which fields have getters and setters instead of direct field access,
`@ExternalGetter` and `@ExternalSetter` can be used to declare those.

### `@Equatable`

Classes and structs marked like this are equal comparable. For structs comparison and hash functions
are auto-generated. For classes only the declaration is generated which needs to be implemented in C++
or otherwise results in linking errors.

**Note:** All fields in structs marked as `@Equatable` need to be of simple type or be marked as
`@Equatable` or `@PointerEquatable` themselves.

### `@PointerEquatable`

Classes marked like this are equal comparable by comparing the instances raw pointer in C++.
Interfaces marked as `@PointerEquatable` also support hashing.

Exception types
---------------

Exception types defined in the IDL correspond to different types or concepts in the generated code,
depending on the target language.

### C++

C++ generated code does not use C++ exceptions concept, mostly to support projects that decide to
disable those for their C++ code. Instead, for functions that have an error type declared, both
return type and error type are wrapped into a custom union-like class `Return<Value, Error>`. This
is done even if the return type is `void`.

There is, however, a slightly different behavior is the error type is an enumeration (for historical
reasons):
* the enumeration type is replaced with `std::error_code` whenever it is used as an error type.
* conversion functions are generated to support implicit conversion from the enum type to `std::error_code`.
* if return type is `void`, `Return<Value, Error>` is replaced by just `std::error_code`.

### Java, Dart

LimeIDL exception types are represented as platform exceptions in Java/Dart generated code. The generated
exception class has a field `error` that carries the value of the error type. There are no
additional conventions, the generated exceptions behave like regular Java/Dart exceptions.

### Swift

LimeIDL exception types are represented throwable types in Swift generated code. This is
accomplished by generating a Swift `extension` for the error type that adds compliance to `Error`
protocol. Moreover, a type alias with the error name pointing to the real error type is generated,
but this is for convenience only and does not affect the functionality in any way.
