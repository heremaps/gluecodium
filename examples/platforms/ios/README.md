# Hello World iOS app

* Open Xcode project
```
open hello_swift.xcodeproj/
```
* In Xcode hello_swift project settings -> General -> Signing you must choose a development team to sign the app.
* Press Run

hello.framework appears missing at first, but the project will generate hello.framework by invoking the build script as the first build step.
