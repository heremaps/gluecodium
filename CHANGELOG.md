# Gluecodium project Release Notes

## Unreleased
 * Kotlin: use `@JvmSynthetic` annotation for Kotlin internal elements whenever possible to hide them from Java code.
 * Kotlin: allow the usage of 'RequiresOptIn' and 'OptIn' annotations for internal API via CLI parameters. This way error is generated when the code, which is not intended to access the internal API uses it. Three new CLI parameters are available: 'androidrequiresoptinannotation', 'androidoptinannotation' and 'androidinternalapiannotationname'.
 * Kotlin: for external types usage in Kotlin, use 'internal' keyword for the types, which are generated by Gluecodium as their 'internal' representation.
 * Kotlin: minimize the usage of 'JvmSuppressWildcards' annotation for collection parameters. This annotation was used for all generated collection types. It needs to be used only when collection type holds enumeration or open type e.g.: 'open class', 'interface' or 'fun interface'.
 * Kotlin: raise error when '@Internal' elements are defined in interfaces. Kotlin language does not allow usage of 'internal' keyword in interfaces. We need to raise an error, because there is no valid way of generating such code.
 * Kotlin: make the 'Impl' classes private. Such classes are used to represent C++ implementation of interface/lambda in Kotlin and they should not be accessed by the users. Only JNI layer should access such types.
 * Kotlin: always handle static properties as get/set pair. Moreover, disallow internal static properties/functions in LimeInterface elements.

## 14.0.0
Release date 2025-12-01
 * Kotlin: Warning -- breaking change! The getters of seconds and nanoseconds in Duration class are replaced with read-only properties.

## 13.20.0
Release date 2025-11-05
### Features:
 * Kotlin: interfaces are now generated as functional interfaces whenever it is possible.
 * Kotlin: static properties of classes can be now accessed also via static getter and setter generated as extension function.
 * Kotlin: generated collection types are immutable.

## 13.19.0
Release date 2025-08-11
### Features:
* Kotlin: reintroduced handling of `@Internal` annotation, which results in usage of `internal` keyword.

## 13.18.0
Release date 2025-08-07
### Features:
 * Dart/FFI: a new public function called `*_library_execute_callbacks_for_isolate_of_current_thread()` is available to execute enqueued callbacks for the current thread. This can be used to implement platform event handlers, which need to wait until certain actions complete. If such handlers block the thread, then no callbacks can be executed -- this may lead to dead locks. The new function can be used together with polling to execute some Dart callbacks while the thread is waiting.
### Bug-fixes:
 * Dart/FFI: the bug related to entering isolate context after the given isolate is closed is solved for execution of Dart callbacks from C++. Since this release the callbacks queue manager received a new function, which checks if callbacks queue for given isolate is open and only in such case enters isolate context before executing a callback.

## 13.17.0
Release date 2025-08-04
### Features:
 * Validation: `LimeLambdaValidator` class is extended with new functionality to raise warning/error when parameters with default names are explicitly documented.
### Bug-fixes:
 * C++: the compilation error in generated C++ code for equatable structure with set of enumerations is fixed by adjusting the template specialization in `UnorderedSetHash.h`.
 * Validation: `LimeValidatorUtils.needsDocumentationComment()` function is extended to avoid raising warnings/errors when a given LimeElement is annotated as internal/skipped for each platform (Java, Kotlin, Swift, Dart).

## 13.16.0
Release date 2025-06-13
### Features:
 * Dart: added support for type aliases (typedefs).
### Bug-fixes:
 * Dart: removed redundant white-spaces from rendered comments for constructors of structures. Adjusted the rendered comments to list parameters using bullet points to improve readability.

## 13.15.1
Release date 2025-06-05
### Bug-fixes:
 * **Kotlin**: fixed warnings from the generated `NativeBase.kt` file related to redundant imports. Fixed warnings related to usage of `!!` operator on non-nullable type in the generated code related to serialization.
 * **Kotlin**: implemented proper handling of custom platform names for accessors of properties. Before this release the generated JNI symbol did not match the signature generated by Kotlin compiler when custom name was used. The problem is fixed via usage of `@JvmName()` for getters and setters.
 * **Validation**: the attributes mismatch validator for Kotlin and Java attributes takes into account also accessors of properties and function parameters. Before this release such problems were not reported.
 * **CMake**: fixed the problem with regeneration of files when `GLUECODIUM_FORCE_USAGE_OF_JNI_FROM_JAVA_GENERATOR` was set. Before this release files were regenerated even if they did not need to be regenerated.

## 13.15.0
Release date 2025-05-26
### Features
 * **CMake**: the limitation which disallowed generating both `android` and `android-kotlin` via CMake is lifted via `GLUECODIUM_FORCE_USAGE_OF_JNI_FROM_JAVA_GENERATOR`.
   When the new optional property is set to `true`, then usage of both generators is allowed. However, the generated Kotlin code uses JNI layer generated by Java generator.
   Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that LIME model for both Java and Kotlin is same -- that's responsibility of the user.
 * **Validation**: the warnings related to android attributes mismatch, which are enabled via `-enableandroidattributesmismatchwarning` can be treated as errors via `werror=AndroidAttributesMismatch`.
### Bug fixes:
 * **Kotlin**: fixed bug related to redundant generation of properties in `Impl` class for nested lambda.
   Prior to this fix the properties were duplicated and caused compilation problems.
 * **Kotlin**: added `@JvmField` annotation to `value` field of generated enumerations. Without that annotation
   the field had to be accessed via getter when Kotlin code was consumed by Java.

## 13.14.0
Release date 2025-05-14
### Features
 * The new version of Gluecodium brings `android-kotlin` generator, which allows rendering Kotlin+JNI files that can be used for Android. The initial release covers generation of all available LIME element types. The supported attributes are the same as for Java. The generated documentation comments follow KDoc: Dokka engine can be used to process them and produce documentation in HTML format. Kotlin generator is exposed via CLI, CMake and gluecodium-gradle plugin.

## 13.13.0
Release date 2025-05-05
### Features
 * Dart/Flutter: the generated code is now compatible with Flutter 3.29 and above. When the user invokes the callback created for lambda/interface from the thread that is the main isolate thread, but outside of isolate context then it is correclty executed. Before this release the thread would deadlock. Now the generated code identifies such case and enters the isolate context before invoking the callback.
 * Java/Kotlin: in order to ease transition from Java to Kotlin the possibility to conditionally warn about mismatch in attributes used for Java/Kotlin is implemented. The following new CLI parameter is available `-enableandroidattributesmismatchwarning` as well as `GLUECODIUM_ENABLE_ANDROID_ATTRIBUTES_MISMATCH_WARNING` CMake parameter.
 * Common: introduced LIME DOC validation rules. Users may use the new CLI parameter called `-docsvalidationrules` or CMake parameter `GLUECODIUM_DOCS_VALIDATION_RULES`, which allow specifying JSON file with regular expressions used to validate comments for certain LIME elements. More information can be found in `lime_markdown.md`.

## 13.12.0
Release date 2025-03-24
### Features
 * Several placeholder files can be specified with CMake property `GLUECODIUM_DOCS_PLACEHOLDERS_LIST` or placeholders can be directly specified in CMake property `GLUECODIUM_DOCS_PLACEHOLDERS`.
 * The new annotation called `@AfterConstruction()` is available and can be used to specify function called after the construction of an object finishes. It should be used for calling platform code from the constructor. More information can be found in `docs/lime_attributes.md`.

## 13.11.0
Release date 2025-03-03
### Features:
 * Implemented placeholders for comments. Gluecodium supports a new `-docsplaceholderslist` CLI parameter and `GLUECODIUM_DOCS_PLACEHOLDERS_LIST` CMake flag, which allow specifying the file with definition of placeholders. More information about possible usage can be found in `lime_markup.md`.

## 13.10.4
Release date 2025-02-13
### Bug fixes:
 * Java: add missing documentation comment to NativeBase class, to avoid triggering warnings.

## 13.10.3
Release date 2025-02-12
### Bug fixes:
 * C++: removed generation of redundant synchronous version of function when `@Async` is used only for C++/Dart and Java/Swift are skipped.
 * LimeParser: introduced non-greedy parsing of new lines for ceratin sub-rules of `constant` rule to prevent meaningless error messages when invalid syntax is used after declaration of a constant.
 * Dart: fixed problem related to missing includes for `@Async` functions.
 * JNI: removed leak of JNI weak references in JniWrapperCache.

## 13.10.2
Release date 2025-01-22
### Bug fixes:
 * Dart: introduced `GLUECODIUM_DART_DISABLE_FINALIZABLE_MARKER` variable as well as `-dartdisablefinalizablemarker` CLI flag, which allows conditionally disabling the usage of `Finalizable` interface from Dart:FFI. It was needed, because the fix introduced in Gluecodium's release `13.10.1` in some rare cases could cause internal compiler issue in Dart SDK (solved in Dart SDK 3.6.0+). This flag is intended to ease the transition to Dart 3.6.0+.
 * Dart: fixed a bug related to compilation error caused by usage of `@PositionalDefaults` and default value for a field that uses type, which does not provide const constructor.
 * Dart: disabled generation of `invalid_use_of_visible_for_testing_member` warning from the generated code for a hierarchy of classes.
 * Dart: removed generation of redundant import for constants declared with external types. The redundant import caused linter warnings.
 * Dart: removed generation of redundant `default` clause in exhaustive switch-cases for enumerations. The redundant `default` caused linter warnings.
 * Java: cleaned up the generated code: removed blank lines. 

## 13.10.1
Release date 2024-12-12
### Bug fixes:
 * Dart: fixed race condition between garbage collector (which could trigger finalizer) and native method calls in finalizable classes.

## 13.10.0
Release date 2024-11-28
### Features:
 * Implemented the new way of documenting properties via `@value` and `@description` annotations in structured comments.
 * Implemented validation, which requires the users to use at least `@value` annotation when documenting a property.
 * Implemented validation of comments used for accessors of properties: parameter of setter and return value of getter. When the required description is missing, then warning is generated. The user may also treat the warning as error via 'werror' flag.
 * Implemented validation of comments used for lambdas. When the description of parameters or return value is missing, then warning is generated. The user may also treat the warning as error via 'werror' flag.
 * Implemented validation of comments used for functions. When the description of parameters or return value is missing, then warning is generated. The user may also treat the warning as error via 'werror' flag.
### Bug fixes:
 * C++: fixed a bug related to invalid default value of nullable field, which uses struct type. When field was nullable and its default value was set to default-constructed structure, then the generated code was invalid, because the field was initialized to std::nullopt instead to default-constructed struct.
 * Gluecodium.kt: fixed a bug related to running 'LimeFunctionsValidator' twice. It was not needed - running the validator once is sufficient.
 * Dart: fixed a bug related to missing 'const' keyword usage in definition of default values in constructors that used immutable structure types when `@Immutable` or `@PositionalDefaults` were specified.
 * Dart: fixed a bug related to missing/superflous 'const' keyword usage in definition of default values in constructors that used collections when `@Immutable` or `@PositionalDefaults` were specified.

## 13.9.7
Release date 2024-11-13
### Bug fixes:
 * Fixed visibilty of symbols from common code (JNI, Dart FFI) in order to resolve problems with build that uses hidden visibility preset.
 * Fixed conversion of platforms for 'Internal' annotation to work correctly also when arguments are not in quotation marks.
 * Dart: generate omitted documentation of properties.

## 13.9.6
Release date: 2024-10-31
### Bug fixes:
 * C++: Fixed generation of getters and setters for accessors attribute -- non-trivial types use references now.

## 11.0.0
Release date: 2022-02-22
### Features:
  * Structs with deprecated fields now have an additional "non-deprecated-fields" constructor generated in Swift. The
  existing "all-fields" constructor is now marked as `@available(*, deprecated)` in Swift for such structs.
### Breaking changes:
  * All-fields constructors are no longer unconditionally generated for mutable structs in Java and Dart. They are now
  generated only if there are no explicitly defined constructors and none of the fields have default values specified.
  * A deprecated field with no default value is now a validation error when Swift code is generated.
### Bug fixes:
  * Fixed compilation issues in all languages when a `Date` literal is used in combination with a type alias.

## 10.7.2
Release date: 2022-02-14
