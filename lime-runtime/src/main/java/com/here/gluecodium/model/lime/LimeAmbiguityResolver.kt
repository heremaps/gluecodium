     * Resolves an ambiguous reference to an element, represented by [relativePath]. The ambiguity is

     * component of the [relativePath]. If it matches, try to resolve it into an actual element
     * through the [referenceMap].
     * * if import resolution fails, try appending [relativePath] to each parent path in
     * [parentPaths] and try resolving the combined path to an actual element through [referenceMap].
     * * if both approaches fail, the reference is invalid: a [LimeModelLoaderException] is thrown.
     * * if more than one match is found, the reference is ambiguous: a [LimeModelLoaderException] is thrown.
