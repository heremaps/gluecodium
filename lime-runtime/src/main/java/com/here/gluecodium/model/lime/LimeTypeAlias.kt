/**
 * There are two different use cases that involve a type alias:
 * * creating a typealias-like element in the target language. This does not require any additional
 * information and can be done solely based on information contained in this class.
 * * handling the type alias as if it actually were the type it points to (this is necessary, for
 * example, for various type conversion routines). This needs additional information obtainable
 * through resolving the [typeRef]. A recommended way to do this is to use [actualType].
