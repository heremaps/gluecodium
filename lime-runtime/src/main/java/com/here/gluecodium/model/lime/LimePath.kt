/**
 * An object of this class represents a "path" in the LIME model tree from the root to some specific
 * element (not necessary a tree leaf). A given path fully identifies the element, there are no two
 * elements with identical paths in the whole model (please not that the model is not a single tree,
 * but several disjoint trees).
 *
 * [tail] represents the traversable portion of the path, i.e. the hierarchy of elements nested in
 * each other that can be traversed back and forth. In contrast, [head] represents the
 * non-traversable part (similar to package or namespace in some languages).
