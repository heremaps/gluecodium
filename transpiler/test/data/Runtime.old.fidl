/**
 * The main entry point to the navigation services.
 *
 * You can use the Runtime class to request an instances of the components and
 * services available here or in the factory. Results are propagated through
 * RuntimeListener which is set when creating an instance via create_runtime().
 *
 * The copy constructor allows you to have many instances of Runtime but each
 * instance points to the same reference counted implementation instance.
 *
 * If the last instance of the Runtime gets deleted, the whole legacy stack gets shut down and cannot
 * be used anymore (equivalent to calling Runtime::shutdown()). Thus at least on copy of the
 * Runtime object must be kept while using legacy.
