/**
 * Generate a language specific model.
 *
 * <h1>Overview</h1>
 *
 * Generators use {@link com.here.genium.generator.common.modelbuilder.ModelBuilder ModelBuilders}
 * to generate a language specific model. The {@code ModelBuilder} itself is a visitor for the
 * language independent Franca model which is traversed by the {@link
 * com.here.genium.generator.common.modelbuilder.FrancaTreeWalker}. Intermediate and final results
 * are stored in {@link com.here.genium.generator.common.modelbuilder.ModelBuilderContext}.
 *
 * <h1>Rationale</h1>
 *
 * The bridging layers for {@link com.here.genium.generator.jni.JniGenerator Java} and {@link
 * com.here.genium.generator.cbridge.CBridgeGenerator Swift} code generation need to forward
 * function calls and convert data types between C++ BaseAPI and Java or C++ BaseAPI and Swift. The
 * specifics of how the C++, Java and Swift code is defined by their generators. To be able to
 * generate bridging code without the need of replicating the generation details also in the
 * bridging generators these need access to the language specific models. To reduce coupling and
 * simplify finding the correspondances between the current element in the bridging generator and
 * the associated C++, Java or Swift model the language independent Franca model is traversed only
 * once for each generator suite and the generators can access the {@link
 * com.here.genium.generator.common.modelbuilder.ModelBuilderContext} from other generators that are
 * run in parallel. This way bridging generators can access the results of the other generators to
 * determine the types and names etc. for the conversion.
