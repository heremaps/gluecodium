# Contributing to Gluecodium

## Where to start? ##
- If you already used Gluecodium and found issues are have improvement ideas, awesome! [Please report these](https://github.com/heremaps/gluecodium/issues/new)!
- You can pick an [issue](https://github.com/heremaps/gluecodium/issues) if you like, some are marked as "good first issue" and should be easy to pick up.
- If you stumbled upon a bug or some unclear or incorrect documentation and you already have a fix, great! Open a [pull request](https://github.com/heremaps/gluecodium/pulls)!

## Signing each Commit

Please sign off each commit of a pull request. There are two ways to do it:

Automatically: Use `-s` (or `--signoff`) flag of `git commit` command, see example below:

`$ git commit -s -m 'README.md: Fix minor spelling mistake'`

Manually add `Signed-off-by:`, as shown in the example below:

```
    README.md: Fix minor spelling mistake

    Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

Any Pull Request with commits that are not signed off will be rejected by the automatic
[DCO check](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/). A DCO is lightweight way for a contributor to
confirm that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit code or documentation to a project.
