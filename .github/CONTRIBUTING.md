## Signing each Commit

Please sign off each commit of a pull request
[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).
Any Pull Request with commits that are not signed off will be reject by the
[DCO check](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/).

A DCO is lightweight way for a contributor to confirm that they wrote or otherwise have the right
to submit code or documentation to a project. Simply add `Signed-off-by` as shown in the example below
to indicate that you agree with the DCO.

An example signed commit message:

```
    README.md: Fix minor spelling mistake

    Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

Git has the `-s` flag that can sign a commit for you, see example below:

`$ git commit -s -m 'README.md: Fix minor spelling mistake'`
