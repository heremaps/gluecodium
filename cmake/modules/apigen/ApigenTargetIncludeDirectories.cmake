# ApigenTargetIncludeDirectories
# ------------------------------
#
# This module attaches additional include directories to the provided target.
# These might differ depending on the previously used generator (cpp, android,
# swift, etc.). This module depends on apigen_generate() to have been run on
# the target first.
#
# .. command:: apigen_target_include_directories
#
# The general form of the command is::
#
#   apigen_target_include_directories(target)
#
